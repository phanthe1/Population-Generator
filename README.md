# Population-Generator
The Population Generator is a software that will generate a population size number given the
input of the state and year. In addition, the application will also receive a CSV input (input.csv)
when it starts and create an output.csv that contains the year, state, and population size. The data
generated is specific to the userâ€™s query. The software is created using the microservice architectural style and
is written in Python.

The Population Generator integrates with the Person Generator microservice. The Person
Generator was created by another developer. The application takes in the year and state. Then,
the application outputs the population size with the list of addresses  to the console.

RPyC exposes the Population Generator application to a port (port 18801) on a machine, in
which other applications can make requests to that exposed port and use its functionality and
vice versa.
